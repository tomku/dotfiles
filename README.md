# Dotfiles

These are my (tomku's) personal configurations for Doom Emacs, fish, tmux and some miscellaneous other tools.  Please feel free to borrow any bits that seem interesting, although I'd suggest staying away from the install/uninstall scripts as they're not particularly robust.

Much has changed since I started this repo - I've switched shells from zsh to fish, and I primarily use Doom Emacs rather than vim/VSCode/Spacemacs. I intend to keep a relatively minimal vim config around in `main` for command-line editing convenience. If you're interested in my editor configuration for older stuff, I've tagged commits immediately before switching to something new.
