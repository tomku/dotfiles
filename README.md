# Dotfiles

These are my (tomku's) personal configurations for Neovim, zsh, tmux and some miscellaneous other tools.  Please feel free to borrow any bits that seem interesting, although I'd suggest staying away from the install/uninstall scripts as they're not particularly robust and need some reworking.

Much has changed since I started this repo - I've switched shells and editors a few times, and the current commit will be whatever I'm using at the moment. I intend to keep a relatively minimal vim config around in `main` for command-line editing convenience. If you're interested in my configuration for older stuff, I've tagged commits immediately before switching to something new.
