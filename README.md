# Dotfiles

These are my (tomku's) personal configurations for vim, zsh, tmux and some miscellaneous other tools.  Please feel free to borrow any bits that seem interesting, although I'd suggest staying away from the install/uninstall scripts as they're not particularly robust.

To get a general idea of the other steps that would be involved in using these files, check out the [Ansible tasks](https://github.com/tomku/ansible-roles/blob/master/dotfiles/tasks/main.yml) I use to set up my user accounts.
